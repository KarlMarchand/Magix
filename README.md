# Magix
Magix is a game created by one of my [teacher](https://github.com/ftheriault) based on an unnamed very popular TCG. I made the interface and look for this game in school as one of our project in web. At first, it was created in PHP with vanilla Javascript but I gradually integrated react and Three.JS towards the end of the project using CDN. For performance reasons and since my database was shutdown at the end of the semester, I wanted to fix this project. So I decided to separate my frontend and make my backend a REST API instead. Since I was starting a new job in .Net, I decided to practice this instead of using PHP.

## The Game:
The winner of the game is the first player to bring his opponent down to 0 hp using his deck of 30 cards. Each card represents a monster with its own health points, attack damage, abilities and mana cost. The player will attack its opponent using a combination of powers, minions and effects. 
    
### The Cards

    
### The Mana 
The player starts with 1 mana and each turn, they gain one but unspent mana is lost after their turn. You use mana to invoke your creature to the table and make them     fight the other player.
